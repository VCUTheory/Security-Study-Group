{"name":"Security-Study-Group","tagline":"A database for bitcoin, crypto-currency, and block chain topics related to security.","body":"### Welcome to VCUTheory, this web page is to be used a database of knowledge related to security topics. Check out our wiki for more information! This project is largely supported by [Dr. Hong-Sheng Zhou](http://computer-science.egr.vcu.edu/faculty/hong-sheng-zhou/) and his PhD student [Thomas Veale](http://vealemachine.me/) in an outreach effort to encourage thought on these important topics. \r\n\r\n### Crypto-currencies \r\nThis site is meant to serve as a body of knowledge for interested people to learn about different coins, technologies such as blockchain and consensus protocols, and cryptographic primitives like hash functions, encryption, and zero knowledge proofs. Please visit our Wiki to learn more about\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
